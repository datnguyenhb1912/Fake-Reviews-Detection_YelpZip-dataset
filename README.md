# Fake Reviews Detection Using YelpZip dataset

## Description

This is the Python notebook created as a part of my Master's thesis in Data Science at La Trobe University (Australia) in 2022. The PDF thesis is included in this repository.

Thesis topic: Detection of Shilling Attack on Recommender Systems and Fake Text Reviews: A Study to Evaluate the Correlation of The Two Approaches.

The code is focused on processing YelpZip dataset and building machine learning models to detect fake reviews. It was written and run on Google Colab, with the dataset stored in a personal Google Drive.
